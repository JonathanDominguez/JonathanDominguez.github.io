      <p>Hello! My name is Jonathan; I'm from south Los Angeles. I first began my coding journey back in 2013 before entering my freshman year of High School, when I took a summer boot camp on tech startups. That year I learned how to create my own website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; however, my role that summer was as a UI/UX designer. It was not until the summer after my sophomore year of high school did I take up the Swift coding language. Throughout that summer, I created an iOS app with little functionality as it was my first time taking up an object-oriented language. Since those summers, I have not looked back.
